“Coronavirus in Lincoln” is organized into four main parts…
* 
* 
* 
1. Landing Page (Congratulations, you are here!)
* Background information on the project
* Mission, author background, etc.
* Written content
* Why were WordPress and Omeka chosen as platforms?
* Why StoryMap and analogue instruments for narration and visualizing?
* How has campus changed in light of the pandemic?
2. Omeka Companion Piece
* Items, Collections, and an Exhibit
* Visualizing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on campus
* Visualizing independent coronavirus messaging in downtown Lincoln
* Less written content with a museum-like approach
* Meta/data details of each item – including but not limited to:
* Date
* Location
* Item type
* Camera information
3. StoryMap 
* Contextualized visual tour of coronavirus messaging in downtown Lincoln 
* Specific locations with corresponding images 
* Sub-stories describing each images 
4. Analogue – “Contribute your voice!”
* Self-made independent coronavirus messaging
* Public engagement 
* Asks viewers to make their own poster to put up in their neighborhood
Each portion of the project is interlinked allowing for easy navigation from the WordPress page to the corresponding Omeka site and StoryMap.
Omeka’s cataloguing of items and artifacts combined with the functional storytelling of WordPress results in a well-rounded insight into a major research university in the time of a pandemic. 
StoryMap’s visualizing capability enables the story of coronavirus in downtown Lincoln to be told fluidly while orienting the viewer to precise locations. 
With pen and paper, the self-made poster represents the outreach capabilities of independent coronavirus messaging. Leading by example, this portion of the project encourages the public to make their own poster that they would want to pin up around their neighborhood.
