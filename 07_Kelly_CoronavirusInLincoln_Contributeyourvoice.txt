An analogue contribution to the coronavirus messaging inspired by the scenes in downtown Lincoln (William Kelly)
By William F. Kelly, M.A.
Reving up the mind’s eye and transferring your fingers from the keyboard to pens or pencils for drawing can be difficult. Nonetheless, the scenes of independent coronavirus messaging witnessed in downtown Lincoln inspired this pseudo-artist to make a contribution of their own in hopes of sparking public engagement. 
With a pencil, a pen, and a sheet of paper, I assembled my visual observations of downtown Lincoln into my own poster. 
A clenched fist – symbolizing the social unrest of 2020 – grips a “LNK” or “Lincoln” mask. 
A lightpost decked with banners similar to the city messaging graces the background. 
And a theater billboard proclaims positive lyrics from a song (“All Together Now,” The Beatles) for pedestrians walking past. 
Finally, the charge “Mask Up!” appears prominently in the foreground to encourage citizens to wear their masks. 
As a result, I have contributed my independent voice to the coronavirus messaging. 
Now, I call on you, viewer. 
Create your own coronavirus messaging poster based on your experience during this pandemic.
Contribute your voice and help foster public engagement in  “Coronavirus in Lincoln”!
