Contextualizing the Pandemic
The pandemic has not paused the fight for racial justice in the United States. How do present events reflect Lincoln’s history of racial (in)justice?

While Black studies, as an academic discipline, is a half-century old, Black resistance to racial terror in Nebraska is far older. Between 1904-1920, Lincoln’s Black population increased by 58%. During the New Deal era, 30% of Lincoln’s Black families – victims of redlining – lived in just one of the city’s twelve wards, which one report described as “ill-kept” and “congested” (Hildebrand 2010, 168). But amid the turmoil of discriminatory Jim Crow policies, Nebraska’s Black community used technology to seize control of their own image and their own humanity.

Indeed, the same intersection at which Black digital humanities finds itself today occurred a century ago: the early 20th-century Black population in Lincoln recovered their own humanity through media (Hildebrand, 170) (Gallon 2016). Rejecting white-manufactured racist and reductive stereotypes of blackness, African American movements in the early 20th century picked up pens, paintbrushes, and cameras to “improv[e] the image and reputation of African Americans in society” (Hildebrand, 169). Groups like the New Negro Movement (NNM) in Lincoln, a foremost example, utilized art, culture, and technology to project their Black humanity and demand civil rights. Although predating contemporary Black Lives Matter movements by a century, the NNM harnessed the power of media to recover their humanity in ways that the BLM movement would eventually replicate (Hildebrand 2010, 169).

Today, America’s Black population is recovering their own image through technology once again in the face of racial terror. Jazari Kual, an African American resident of Lincoln, acknowledged this deep past of racial justice movements in Nebraska during a podcast interview recently (“The Commonwealth on Twitter” 2020). Carrying forward Lincoln’s racial justice tradition, Kual has become “one of the leading sources of raw, unedited protest footage in Lincoln and Omaha” (Sierra Karst 2020). Kual and the Black Lives Matter movement, similar its ancestral New Negro Movement, use media technologies and their additional features to produce their own representation of the Black struggle. As a result, millions of social media users can witness, often in real time, the fight against racial terror in the 21st century (Noble 2019, 30).
Racial justice is possible in academic spheres, too. Scholar Kim Gallon underlines, and as the work of Jazari Kual exhibits, the “technology of recovery operates as the shared basis for black academic and nonacademic digital work” (Gallon 2016). The Colored Conventions Project expertly showcases this academic-public intersection by “ensuring the Black humanity in Black data/curation” (“#DivBlk” 2020). Amid self-reflective and transparent blog posts, visitors can also find links to help the Black Lives Matter movement, register to vote, and to complete the 2020 Census. Not only does the project disrupt white narratives that ignored records of 19th-century Black political involvement, it connects such political involvement to the pressing contemporary issues of racial equity and justice. The project goes beyond simply digitizing blackness and shows the realistic nature of Safiya Umoja Noble’s charge: that “[c]ritical DH scholarship working in a Black studies tradition can spark increased visibility of, commitment to, and intervention in the grand challenges of inequality” (Noble 2019, 29, 31).
“Although predating contemporary Black Lives Matter movements by a century, the NNM harnessed the power of media to recover their humanity in ways that the BLM movement would eventually replicate.”  
Before black digital humanities “trouble[d] the very core of what we have come to know as the humanities,” members of the New Negro Movement in Nebraska used technology to recover Black humanity (Gallon 2016; Hildebrand 2010, 168). Involved citizens like Jazari Kual carry that torch today and put into public practice much of the ideas of Gallon and Noble. To be sure, from at least the New Negro Movement in Lincoln to the city’s current Black Lives Matter movement, Nebraska’s Black community has fought for image recovery through technology.
