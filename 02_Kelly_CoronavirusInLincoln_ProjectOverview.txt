Project Overview

William F. Kelly, M.A. is a Ph.D. student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying history and the digital humanities.
In the fall of 2020, “fresh” out of a summer of quarantine, he embarked on an endeavor to document the sights, sounds, and behaviors of campus life in the age of the Coronavirus pandemic.
Observations have been made, images captured, and metadata recorded.
