Choosing the Best Platform
By William F. Kelly, M.A.
STORYTELLING OR SCHOLARSHIP….OR BOTH?
Omeka, Flickr, WordPress, and Blogger overlap and contrast in a few important ways. It is clear that Blogger and WordPress are both utilized for storytelling. And the functionality, creativity, and clarity of WordPress surpasses that of Blogger. However, while the blog platforms focus on textual narratives, the interface and metadata of Flickr is tailored predominantly to photographers. Conversely, Omeka’s strengths are in the platform’s ability to compile a vast amount of metadata for a variety of different artifacts or “items.” In sum, in order to gain the most out of any one of these platforms, one must have a clear idea about what form their final project will take.
It is clear that Blogger as a subsidiary of Google. While this visual and functional familiarity might comfort the user, Blogger did not do enough to improve upon the shortfalls of, say, Google Docs. While writing a post was easy, adding images and reorganizing that post accordingly was a rigid and frustrating process.
One of the “pros” of Blogger is the platform’s focus on the creator and their statistics. Because the site is creator-focused, it tracks a decent array of administrative metadata. The home screen is especially meant for tracking views, clicks, comments, and other metrics. But this numbers-focused approach hinders the site’s overall ability to allow the creator to actually be creative.
It is clear that the “block system” allows WordPress to be used by a variety of industries – from the small business owner to the emerging artist.
WordPress outpaces Blogger. This platform is far more creator-friendly; that is, WordPress allows the blogger to express their ideas through different tools. By utilizing the “block system” of organization, content creators can insert normal paragraphs, business hours, podcasts, poems, collages or slideshows of media, or any number of the other diverse content options available. It is clear that the “block system” allows WordPress to be used by a variety of industries – from the small business owner to the emerging artist.
WordPress and Blogger seem to be on par concerning measuring and tracking metadata. However, WordPress conveys your metadata more graphically than Blogger. This enables the user to see their metadata in terms of trendlines and high traffic hours.
Flickr has an entirely different function and target audience than WordPress or Blogger. Focused on photographers, Flickr automatically pulls technical metadata about the image you upload: type of camera, the lens the photo was captured with, whether the flash was on, etc. (This is a key point of contrast between Flickr and its closest relative of the four platforms, Omeka.) But this collection of technical metadata overshadows any descriptive metadata about the image itself. There is much more focus on the technicality of the camera than about what was actually captured. With its easy navigation, comment boxes, and access to a trove of other images, Flickr operates more like a social network than any of the other platforms.
While the functionality can be monotonous, Omeka is the most complete platform for scholars. Despite having to manually input metadata into a lengthy list of text boxes, the capability to fully document an item’s structural, descriptive, and administrative metadata is extremely useful. However, the ability to actually track metadata is not available with the free trial (but may be available on the other side of the pay wall).
Perhaps the best way to describe Omeka is as an archivist’s blog: a slightly underdeveloped ability for prose creation combined with the virtual template of physical archives.
Omeka users who want to include a narrative with their items might be frustrated at the beginning. Initially, it seems that Omeka’s only function is uploading images of items, organizing them into collections with other like items, and then creating exhibits with very little story adding context or life to items. The UNL Archaeology Project might be an example of this with its cold appearance and dry content. But once “pages” are added and the different layout options are discovered, the user can construct a decent story  that weaves in and out of their exhibits. Perhaps the best way to describe Omeka is as an archivist’s blog: a slightly underdeveloped ability for prose creation combined with the virtual template of physical archives.
Overall, the choice of which platform is best remains up to the user. Creative writers or small businesses might be more inclined to utilize the “block” system of WordPress. Archivists or Pulitzer Prize-winning authors might choose Omeka. Either way, these two platforms surpass their closest competitors in overall style, functionality, and metadata collection. Omeka and WordPress will be a part of my own research and the courses I teach in the coming years.
