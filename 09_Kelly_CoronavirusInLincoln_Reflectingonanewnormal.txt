ADAPTATION
I found myself one Thursday afternoon camped at two contrasting locations on campus to observe the pandemic’s effect on UNL campus life. A table by the busy Nebraska Union and a table behind the more sedate Sheldon were my bases. I initially assumed that pedestrian traffic would not only be down in intensity, but that people would be in smaller groups or walking solo around campus. While this was partially proven true, I unexpectedly noticed a new silence on campus. Both the Nebraska Union and the Sheldon have adapted to the pandemic. But a fuller, more sensory observation concludes that adaptation might serve physical spaces more than the social. It was as if I had engaged in the type of conversation with my campus surroundings that, for Hunter et al., “sparks observation and critique.” Indeed, this silence prompted me to re-frame how I thought of campus during the Coronavirus pandemic.
~11:00am, the Union: Starbucks or Dunkin’ coffee tethering to a sense of normalcy while they weaved through “mask up” signs and hand sanitizer stations by themselves or with a partner. Only on rare occasions did I see students traveling with two or more friends in tow. Arching over sporadic audible conversations was the Union was the fountain’s splashing waters that seemed to rush through the physical gaps between socially distanced studying students. Only one pair of students sat together at the same table out of the 30 or so I counted seated outside the Union. After thirty minutes of observation, strings of students walked through the plaza, most of whom wore face coverings while many did not. In and out of the Union they went – each one trying to make the most of their “college experience” as they adapted to a “new normal.”  
~11:45am, the Sheldon: I did not believe that campus life could get quieter. But the four students scattered among the many picnic tables provided proved me wrong. Aside from the occasional bicyclist pedaling past the same “mask up” signs and hand sanitizer stations, or a UNL landscaper working on the shrubberies, little human-made noise was audible. It became immediately clear that the Union remains the campus hub; so much goes on inside the building, pulling students for coffee or books or food, that the pandemic cannot severe all activity entirely.
Hunter et al. argue that “makerspaces” can be wherever the maker resides and wherever a “historically situated critique” hosts an “intersection of disciplines” (130, 132, 135). The observational story above is something “made.” I have engaged in a sort of “historical spatial thinking” about two separate locations on UNL’s campus and have come to the conclusion that both locations have physically adapted to the pandemic, while the greater impact has fallen on the social, conversational components of campus life (132). Students can still check out computers in the Union or visit the Sheldon, but they cannot have the same social interactions as before the pandemic. How can I digitally illustrate this?
A lesson for a “maker”: the “thought and imagination” that stems from “conversation and debate” can also adapt to the pandemic through sensory engagement with your surroundings – a much safer form of dialogue.
To take this writing further would be to illustrate these findings via a digital tool that lets my surroundings visually speak for themselves. One idea is a virtual coffee table book (medium: Flickr) that would make the scenes I observed front and center, while accenting the images with story-like descriptions below with the aim of placing the mind of the reader/viewer “on campus.” Another idea would be to include a VR tour of campus from images that I captured and to overlay audio recordings of each location on campus. The goal is to repeat my first-hand sensory observations on this digital landscape for readers/viewers.
