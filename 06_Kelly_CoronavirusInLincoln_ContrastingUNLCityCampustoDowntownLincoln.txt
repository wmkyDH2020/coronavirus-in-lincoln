Contrasting UNL City Campus to Downtown Lincoln
Both areas have been observed and documented. How are they different?


University messaging is centralized, while artists and businesses have more freedom to express concerns on posters and signage downtown.
By William F. Kelly, M.A.
Observing downtown Lincoln, the assignment could be flipped as such: how has downtown not changed since the pandemic? It was far easier to find answers to the question posed this way than its opposite. While there were signs encouraging citizens to wear masks, and the “Beatles v. Stones” show at the Rococo Theatre was rescheduled, the vast majority of life downtown felt eerily similar to pre-pandemic conditions. To slightly adjust the important minimalist question posed by Gil and Sayers, citizens seemingly asked themselves: what is the least we need to do to survive while tethered to normalcy? Such minimalist approaches by Lincolnians led to my observations; namely, familiar sounds and smells of downtown, college students taking advantage of sidewalk sales, and Chipotle operating as lively during the lunch hour as ever before. But how do these observations relate to the ones made of UNL campus just a few weeks before?
The pandemical boundaries between UNL campus and downtown Lincoln were physically marked by the sudden absence of hand sanitizing stations and University sanctioned public health signs. Initially, I assumed the behavior of those who were off-campus would also signal their entry into city regulations. But upon reflection (quite literally as I wrote), I pushed back against myself. Not all those who were hastily crossing the street with their lunch or coffees were wearing a mask.  Indeed, city guidelines do not enforce a mask mandate outdoors. Yet, the same could be said for the students I observed passing by the Nebraska Union with their Dunkin’ coffees a few weeks ago.  Signs declaring “masks required in this area” were posted on campus, but not all students heeded the policy. This brief comparison has shown me how humans, students in particular, might be subject to laws or policies but operate in its interstices.

Armed with previous observational experiences from unit #1, I made sure to take some pictures as I made my observations for reference and metadata. To be sure, knowing the end goal for Dev. Pub. #2 helped me refine my observational approach this time around. For example, a collection of posters were pinned in a showcase along Lincoln’s “Art District.” The artist for each poster took inspiration from cult-classic movies to encourage citizens to wear masks. In one poster, the Dude (a.k.a. Jeffrey Lebowski or El Duderino, if you’re not into the whole brevity thing) held his half & half, dawned a mask, and implored Lincolnians to “abide” by mask policies. While at first glance not all of downtown Lincoln seemed to be affected by the pandemic, visuals such as these illustrate the imagery and messages alive among the behavior of citizens. 
There was more similarity between UNL’s pandemic response and that of the city’s than I initially suspected. Familiar sights and sounds prevailed at both locations. Public health messages – while exported from different sources – were posted at various spots. And human behavior, unfortunately, tried to resume normally amidst abnormal circumstances.
