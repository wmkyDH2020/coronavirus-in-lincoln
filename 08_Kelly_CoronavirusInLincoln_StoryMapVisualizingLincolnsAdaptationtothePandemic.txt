StoryMap: Visualizing Lincoln’s Adaptation to the Pandemic
* 
By William F. Kelly, M.A.
Highlighting independent coronavirus messaging scattered throughout downtown Lincoln, Nebraska, is a crucial objective of this StoryMap. But this project calls for something more than disjointed locations on a map. 
Coronavirus in downtown Lincoln is a story. As such, it requires the images compiled to be explained with descriptions – all united under a grand narrative banner.
More simply, the theme of my StoryMap is coronavirus messaging in downtown Lincoln. Is there signage downtown encouraging citizens to wear masks and socially distance? If so, who made them? What language/rhetoric do the signs use? 
Images are the bedrock of this project. And these images are contextualized with prose. Hard data, numbers, or statistics that require representation are not germane. Therefore, other mapping platforms such as GeoJSON or GitHub – with their colder interfaces and difficult narrative building – were ill-suited for this project.
While StoryMap is limited in some areas, it more easily provides an attractive interface for viewers. With my map, viewers can fluidly jump from street to street and site to site around downtown Lincoln to gain a comprehensive sense of the coronavirus messaging downtown through images and contextualizing “placards.”
