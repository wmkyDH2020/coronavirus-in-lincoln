A Reflection on the Conflict Between the Land and the People of Nebraska
Recently, I found myself getting so caught up in my digital work that I failed to recognize what physical conditions made this work even possible…

When the University of Nebraska was established in 1869, the land only been in white hands for 15 years (Jones et al. 2017, 432). Even today, we are only the land’s most recent overseers (“Creation of a campus”). A deeper plunge into the geographic history of UNL and Lincoln recognizes that the history of this land, known by the Otoe word, “Nebraska,” has been stewarded by more indigenous people than we commonly remember (Naugle 2018, 1, 9-10).
Spanning over 12,000 years, inhabitants of central North America have walked through the gauntlet of climate and land. Paleo-Indians, nomadic hunters of now extinct megafauna, vanished from the land approximately 9,000 years ago on the cusp of a warming climate (Naugle, 9). Archaic nomads replaced them until Plains-Woodlands cultured humans displaced their Archaic counterparts. Village Farmers then occupied the land after the Plains-Woodlands people until they, too, disappeared by the 15th century leaving the drought-ridden Plains unoccupied for a century (Naugle, 11). 
“A deeper plunge into the geographic history of UNL and Lincoln recognizes that the history of this land, known by the Otoe word, “Nebraska,” has been stewarded by more indigenous people than we commonly remember.”
In the mid- to late-16th century, European military units describe, through their Eurocentric pens, tribes like the Wichitas, Pawnees, Otoes, Poncas, and others (Naugle, 11-13). Furs and firearms, alcohol and horses, disease and bloodshed – as well as culture and customs – were all exchanged in this fluid “middle ground” (White 1991, 2010).
By the 19th century, violent conflict, treaty making (and breaking), railroads, and white settler colonialism in Nebraska increasingly pushed native tribes away from Lincoln (Jones et al. 389). Meanwhile, the land grant University of Nebraska grew. Later, renewed conflict engulfed federal government, indigenous Nebraskans, and UNL students and faculty in the 20th century.

Prompted by the actions of AIM in 1969, UNL affiliates developed Tutors of Nebraska Indian Children (TONIC) to educate future white reservation tutors on historic and contemporary indigenous cultures. Amid the indigenous civil rights movements, UNL developed the Council of American Indian Students (CAIS) in 1970 to give an association under which Native students can convene. In November 1972, members of Lincoln’s AIM chapter led a protest in correspondence with the Trail of Broken Treaties march in Washington, D.C. Again, UNL students and faculty joined indigenous Nebraskans in the protest (Borgmann 2019).
Conflict ignited again on campus with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990. UNL failed to document all Native remains on campus when thousands of indigenous bones were discovered in Bessey Hall in 1997. Investigations and lawsuits ensued out of which two revelations emerged. First, that Ponca, Pawnee, and Arika remains were improperly experimented upon prior to the NAGPRA. Second, that an unknown number of indigenous bones were incinerated on East Campus in the 1960s at which site a memorial marker was laid in 2001 (Hotory et al. 2010).
Out of all the sources analyzed in this research, few reckon with the violence and destruction of Lincoln’s and the University’s entangled history with Native America. Plaques and inventories hardly bring justice. In terms of acknowledging the locational history of one’s DH work, such a reckoning is a required next step.
